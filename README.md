* Import all datasets from csv files into each script
* Conduct procedures regarding data wrangling and consistent checks after importation of data
* Merge all data sets into a single data set
* Derive new columns from old columns to meet certain needs of the analysis
* Generate visualizations to communicate insights to stakeholders
* Organize Python scripts with headings and decriptive comments
