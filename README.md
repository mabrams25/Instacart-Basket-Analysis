# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis 

Project is based on an online grocery delivery app. Performed an initial data and exploratory analysis of Instacart's sales patterns and customers' ordering habits. Derived insights and suggested marketing strategies for better segmentation.

**Primary Objectives:**

* Import all datasets from csv files into each script
* Conduct procedures regarding data wrangling and consistent checks after importation of data
* Merge all data sets into a single data set
* Derive new columns from old columns to meet certain needs of the analysis
* Generate visualizations to communicate insights to stakeholders
* Organize Python scripts with headings and decriptive comments
